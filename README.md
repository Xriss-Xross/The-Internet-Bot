# The Internet Bot
This is a custom bot that I made for Fomm's discord server.

## Where is ~help?
I'm currently working on a website for the help section among many other things. For now it will all be in a [help.md](src/~help.md) file in /src.
 
## Found any issues?
If you need any help operating the bot or something seems to be wrong with it, please don't hesitate to email me at ```xriss_xross@outlook.com``` AFTER looking at the [help file](src/~help.md)
