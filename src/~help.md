# ~help
This .md will hopefully be replaced by my website in the coming months. Stay tuned!... or don't... at this rate it'll never happen.


## ~play
With the ~play command you can queue youtube videos with both links and just regular search terms and as of recently, you can also queue youtube playlists.

## ~pause
Momentarily pauses the audio currently playing.

## ~resume
Resumes any audio that was paused.

## ~search
After the search command you can put in search terms e.g. ```~search the wombats```. The Internet will then respond with a list of five videos. All you need to do is respond with a number from 1 -> 5 (Don't worry the video titles have numbers next to them to make it easier). An example interaction would be:
```~search the wombats```
```
